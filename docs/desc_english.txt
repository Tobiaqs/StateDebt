Public Debt Clock

description:
This app gives you live insight in the public debt of almost 50 countries. In addition to the evergrowing debt, the population, GDP, debt per person, debt as percentage of the GDP and the raise per second are shown. The amount is updated ten times each second. Another handy feature is being able to convert all amounts to USD.

Big thanks to www.nationaldebtclocks.org. Information from their website is used in this app.
